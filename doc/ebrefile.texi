@chapter Introduction

A CD-ROM book usually has some @dfn{subbooks}.
For example, a certain CD-ROM book has three subbooks; Japanese
dictionary, Japense English dictinary and English Japanese dictionary.
Each subbook itself is an independent @dfn{book}.

@example
@group
            (CD-ROM book)
+-----------------------------------+
|  [English Dicctionary] (subbook)  |
|  [Japanese Dicctionary](subbook)  |
|  [Encyclopedia]        (subbook)  |
+-----------------------------------+
@end group
@end example

A CD-ROM book of EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA format has the file
@file{CATALOG},
and a CD-ROM book of EPWING format has the file @file{CATALOGS}.
The files define what subbooks the CD-ROM book has.
They are resides at the top directory of the CD-ROM book.

@code{ebrefile} reads an original catalog file and builds a new catalog
file which defines the subbooks only specified by an user.
In other words, @code{ebrefile} can deletes particular subbook definitions
from a catalog file.
If a CD-ROM book has three subbooks, @code{ebrefile} can imports any
one or two subbooks to the new catalog file.
The @code{ebrefile} command is useful when you want to copy only a
part of a CD-ROM book to a hard disk. 
@code{ebrefile} is a part of EB Library distribution.

@chapter Invoking @code{ebrefile}

Its usual way to invoke @code{ebrefile} is as follows:

@example
% ebrefile @var{book-path}
@end example

@noindent
@var{book-path} points to the top directory of a CD-ROM book where
the file @file{CATALOG} or @file{CATALOGS} resides.
Though you cannot specify two or more book-paths, 
you can omit book-path like as follows:

@example
% ebrefile
@end example

@noindent
In this case, @code{ebrefile} assumes that the current working directory
(@file{.}) is specified.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Select Subbooks, Adjust Filename, Invoking ebrefile, Invoking ebrefile
@section Select Subbooks

By default, @code{ebrefile} imports all subbook definitions in an original
catalog file to a new catalog file.
In short, the new catalog file is simply copied from an original.
The default behavoir is useless.
@code{ebrefile} is usually invoked with @samp{--subbook} (@samp{-S})
option.

The @samp{--subbook} option takes an argument which is a list of
directory names of subbooks to be imported, separeted by a comma
(@samp{,}).
The @code{ebinfo} command tells you what subbooks your book contains
and what their directory names are.
Suppose that the current working directory is a top directory of a
CD-ROM book.

@example
@group
% ebinfo
disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
character code: JIS X 0208
the number of subbooks: 3
@end group

@group
subbook 1:
  title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
  directory: ENGLISH
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

@end group
@group
subbook 2:
  title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
  directory: FRENCH
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

@end group
@group
subbook 3:
  title: Pocket German Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
  directory: GERMAN
  search methods: menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
@end group
@end example

@noindent
(@xref{Invoking ebinfo, , Invoking @code{ebinfo}, ebinfo, ebinfo},
for more details about the @code{ebinfo} command).
@*
In this example, there are three subbooks in the book, and their 
directory names are @code{ENGLISH}, @code{FRENCH} and @code{GERMAN}.

Invoking the following command, @code{ebrefile} build a new catalog file
which has definitions of @code{ENGLISH} and @code{FRENCH} only.

@example
% ebrefile --subbook english,french
@end example

@noindent
Case of the directory names are not sensitve.
An argument to @samp{--subbook} can be splitted like as follows:

@example
% ebrefile --subbook english --subbook french
@end example

@noindent
Since @code{ebrefile} cannot change an order of subbook definitions,
an order of arguments to @samp{--subbook} is not matter.

The original @file{CATALOG(S)} file is moved to @file{CATALOG(S).bak},
and a new file is put as @file{CATALOG(S)}.
It means that the top directory of the CD-ROM book must be writable.
In other words, at least @file{CATALOG(S)} of the CD-ROM book must
have already been copied to a hard disk before invoking @code{ebrefile}.
(However, this rule is not applied when the @samp{--output-directory}
option is used.
@xref{Summary of Options, , @samp{--output-directory}}, for more details
about the @samp{--output-directory} option).

Invoke @code{ebinfo} again.
The subbook @code{GERMGAN} is diappeared.

@example
@group
% ebinfo
disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
character code: JIS X 0208
the number of subbooks: 2
@end group

@group
subbook 1:
  title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
  directory: ENGLISH
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

@end group
@group
subbook 2:
  title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
  directory: FRENCH
  search methods: word endword keyword menu
  font sizes: 16 24 30 48
  narrow font characters: 
  wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
@end group
@end example

If you have already copied whole the CD-ROM book onto a hard disk,
you may remove files of the subbook @code{GERMAN}.
When the directory name consists of upper case letters, type:

@example
% rm -r GERMAN
@end example

@noindent
When the directory name consists of lower case letters, type:

@example
% rm -r german
@end example

@node Adjust Filename, Combination with ebzip, Select Subbooks, Invoking ebrefile
@section Adjust Filename

@code{ebrefile} keeps @dfn{case} (upper or lower) and @dfn{suffix} of
the original catalog file.
When the catalog filename is @file{catalogs;1} (case is lower, and suffix
is @samp{;1}), @code{ebrefile} puts a new catalog file as
@file{catalogs;1}, and backup the original catalog file as
@file{catalogs.bak;1}.

The following table displayes how a filename of @file{CATALOG(S)}
file changes.

@multitable @columnfractions .4 .3 .3
@item case/suffix       @tab original file      @tab backup file
@item lower/none        @tab catalog            @tab catalog.bak
@item lower/dot         @tab catalog.           @tab catalog.bak
@item lower/version     @tab catalog;1          @tab catalog.bak;1
@item lower/dot+version @tab catalog.;1         @tab catalog.bak;1
@item upper/none        @tab CATALOG            @tab CATALOG.BAK
@item upper/dot         @tab CATALOG.           @tab CATALOG.BAK
@item upper/version     @tab CATALOG;1          @tab CATALOG.BAK;1
@item upper/dot+version @tab CATALOG.;1         @tab CATALOG.BAK;1
@end multitable

The @samp{--case} and @samp{--suffix} options allows you to modify
these case and suffix styles of new catalog file and backup file.
The @samp{--case} option takes an argument, and it must be @samp{upper}
or @samp{lower}.
The option sets the case of the filename @code{CATALOG(S)} and 
@code{CATALOG(S).BAK} to upper or lower.
Also the @samp{--suffix} option takes an argument, and it must be
@samp{none}, @samp{dot}, @samp{version} or @samp{both}.
The option sets the suffix style of the filename @code{CATALOG(S)}
and @code{CATALOG(S).BAK} to none, dot, version or both (dot+version).

@node Combination with ebzip,  , Adjust Filename, Invoking ebrefile
@section Combination with @code{ebzip}

@code{ebrefile} can be used together with the @code{ebzip} command,
which compresses files in a CD-ROM book
(@xref{Introduction, , Introduction, ebzip, ebzip}, for more details
about the @code{ebzip} command).
Usually, the same command line arguments are given to @code{ebzip}
and @code{ebrefile}.

Suppose that a CD-ROM book is mounted on @code{/cdrom}, and this
book has three subbooks; @code{ENGLISH}, @code{FRENCH} and @code{GERMAN}.
By the following operation, the subbook @code{ENGLISH} and @code{FRENCH}
are compressed and put under the current working directory, and the
subbook @code{GERMAN} are deleted from a subbook list.

@example
% ebzip --subbook english,french /cdrom
% ebrefile --subbook english,french /cdrom
@end example

@noindent
If you'd like to put the compressed files onto @file{/dict} instead
of the current working directory, type the following:

@example
% ebzip --output-directory /dict --subbook english,french /cdrom
% ebrefile --output-directory /dict --subbook english,french /cdrom
@end example

@noindent
Case and suffix of filenames are adjusted by the @samp{--case} and
@samp{--suffix} options.

@example
% ebzip --case lower --suffix none --subbook english,french /cdrom
% ebrefile --case lower --suffix none --subbook english,french /cdrom
@end example
