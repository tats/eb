Introduction
************

   A CD-ROM book usually has some "subbooks".  For example, a certain
CD-ROM book has three subbooks; Japanese dictionary, Japense English
dictinary and English Japanese dictionary.  Each subbook itself is an
independent "book".

                 (CD-ROM book)
     +-----------------------------------+
     |  [English Dicctionary] (subbook)  |
     |  [Japanese Dicctionary](subbook)  |
     |  [Encyclopedia]        (subbook)  |
     +-----------------------------------+

   A CD-ROM book of EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA format has the file
`CATALOG', and a CD-ROM book of EPWING format has the file `CATALOGS'.
The files define what subbooks the CD-ROM book has.  They are resides
at the top directory of the CD-ROM book.

   `ebrefile' reads an original catalog file and builds a new catalog
file which defines the subbooks only specified by an user.  In other
words, `ebrefile' can deletes particular subbook definitions from a
catalog file.  If a CD-ROM book has three subbooks, `ebrefile' can
imports any one or two subbooks to the new catalog file.  The
`ebrefile' command is useful when you want to copy only a part of a
CD-ROM book to a hard disk.  `ebrefile' is a part of EB Library
distribution.

`ebrefile' modifies contents of a certain file in a CD-ROM book.

Invoking `ebrefile'
*******************

   Its usual way to invoke `ebrefile' is as follows:

     % ebrefile BOOK-PATH

BOOK-PATH points to the top directory of a CD-ROM book where the file
`CATALOG' or `CATALOGS' resides.  Though you cannot specify two or more
book-paths, you can omit book-path like as follows:

     % ebrefile

In this case, `ebrefile' assumes that the current working directory
(`.') is specified.

Select Subbooks
===============

   By default, `ebrefile' imports all subbook definitions in an original
catalog file to a new catalog file.  In short, the new catalog file is
simply copied from an original.  The default behavoir is useless.
`ebrefile' is usually invoked with `--subbook' (`-S') option.

   The `--subbook' option takes an argument which is a list of
directory names of subbooks to be imported, separeted by a comma (`,').
The `ebinfo' command tells you what subbooks your book contains and
what their directory names are.  Suppose that the current working
directory is a top directory of a CD-ROM book.

     % ebinfo
     disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
     character code: JIS X 0208
     the number of subbooks: 3
     
     subbook 1:
       title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
       directory: ENGLISH
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
     subbook 2:
       title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
       directory: FRENCH
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters:
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
     subbook 3:
       title: Pocket German Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
       directory: GERMAN
       search methods: menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters:
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

(*Note Invoking `ebinfo': (ebinfo)Invoking ebinfo, for more details
about the `ebinfo' command).
In this example, there are three subbooks in the book, and their
directory names are `ENGLISH', `FRENCH' and `GERMAN'.

   Invoking the following command, `ebrefile' build a new catalog file
which has definitions of `ENGLISH' and `FRENCH' only.

     % ebrefile --subbook english,french

Case of the directory names are not sensitve.  An argument to
`--subbook' can be splitted like as follows:

     % ebrefile --subbook english --subbook french

Since `ebrefile' cannot change an order of subbook definitions, an
order of arguments to `--subbook' is not matter.

   The original `CATALOG(S)' file is moved to `CATALOG(S).bak', and a
new file is put as `CATALOG(S)'.  It means that the top directory of
the CD-ROM book must be writable.  In other words, at least
`CATALOG(S)' of the CD-ROM book must have already been copied to a hard
disk before invoking `ebrefile'.  (However, this rule is not applied
when the `--output-directory' option is used.  *Note
`--output-directory': Summary of Options, for more details about the
`--output-directory' option).

   Invoke `ebinfo' again.  The subbook `GERMGAN' is diappeared.

     % ebinfo
     disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
     character code: JIS X 0208
     the number of subbooks: 2
     
     subbook 1:
       title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
       directory: ENGLISH
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
     subbook 2:
       title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
       directory: FRENCH
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters:
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

   If you have already copied whole the CD-ROM book onto a hard disk,
you may remove files of the subbook `GERMAN'.  When the directory name
consists of upper case letters, type:

     % rm -r GERMAN

When the directory name consists of lower case letters, type:

     % rm -r german

Adjust Filename
===============

   `ebrefile' keeps "case" (upper or lower) and "suffix" of the
original catalog file.  When the catalog filename is `catalogs;1' (case
is lower, and suffix is `;1'), `ebrefile' puts a new catalog file as
`catalogs;1', and backup the original catalog file as `catalogs.bak;1'.

   The following table displayes how a filename of `CATALOG(S)' file
changes.

case/suffix                   original file          backup file            
lower/none                    catalog                catalog.bak            
lower/dot                     catalog.               catalog.bak            
lower/version                 catalog;1              catalog.bak;1          
lower/dot+version             catalog.;1             catalog.bak;1          
upper/none                    CATALOG                CATALOG.BAK            
upper/dot                     CATALOG.               CATALOG.BAK            
upper/version                 CATALOG;1              CATALOG.BAK;1          
upper/dot+version             CATALOG.;1             CATALOG.BAK;1          

   The `--case' and `--suffix' options allows you to modify these case
and suffix styles of new catalog file and backup file.  The `--case'
option takes an argument, and it must be `upper' or `lower'.  The
option sets the case of the filename `CATALOG(S)' and `CATALOG(S).BAK'
to upper or lower.  Also the `--suffix' option takes an argument, and
it must be `none', `dot', `version' or `both'.  The option sets the
suffix style of the filename `CATALOG(S)' and `CATALOG(S).BAK' to none,
dot, version or both (dot+version).

Combination with `ebzip'
========================

   `ebrefile' can be used together with the `ebzip' command, which
compresses files in a CD-ROM book (*Note Introduction:
(ebzip)Introduction, for more details about the `ebzip' command).
Usually, the same command line arguments are given to `ebzip' and
`ebrefile'.

   Suppose that a CD-ROM book is mounted on `/cdrom', and this book has
three subbooks; `ENGLISH', `FRENCH' and `GERMAN'.  By the following
operation, the subbook `ENGLISH' and `FRENCH' are compressed and put
under the current working directory, and the subbook `GERMAN' are
deleted from a subbook list.

     % ebzip --subbook english,french /cdrom
     % ebrefile --subbook english,french /cdrom

If you'd like to put the compressed files onto `/dict' instead of the
current working directory, type the following:

     % ebzip --output-directory /dict --subbook english,french /cdrom
     % ebrefile --output-directory /dict --subbook english,french /cdrom

Case and suffix of filenames are adjusted by the `--case' and
`--suffix' options.

     % ebzip --case lower --suffix none --subbook english,french /cdrom
     % ebrefile --case lower --suffix none --subbook english,french /cdrom

Summary of `ebrefile' Options
*****************************

   The `ebrefile' command supports both traditional single-letter
options and mnemonic long option names.  Long option names are
indicated with `--' instead of `-'.  Abbreviations for option names are
allowed as long as they are unique.

`-c CASE'
`--case CASE'
     Output a catalog file which have filenames with upper or lower CASE
     letters.  CASE must be `upper' or `lower'.  When this option is
     not specified, the case of the new catalog filename comes to be
     the same as a filename of orignal catalog file.  (*Note Adjust
     Filename::, for more details).

`-h'
`--help'
     Output help message to standard out, then exit.

`-o DIRECTORY'
`--output-directory DIRECTORY'
     Output a new catalog file under DIRECTORY.  By default, `ebrefile'
     generates a new catalog file under the current working directory
     (`.').  (*Note Invoking ebrefile::, for more details).

`-s SUFFIX'
`--suffix SUFFIX'
     Specify the suffix of filename of new catalog file.  SUFFIX must
     be `none', `dot', `version' or `both'.  When SUFFIX is `none', no
     suffix is appended.  When SUFFIX is `dot', a dot (`.') is appended.
     When SUFFIX is `version', a version number 1 (`;1') is appended.
     When SUFFIX is `both', dot and version number 1 (`.;1') is
     appended.  If this option is not specified, the suffix of the new
     catalog filename comes to be the same as a filename of original
     catalog file.  (*Note Adjust Filename::, for more details).

`-S SUBBOOKS'
`--subbook SUBBOOKS'
     Specify subbooks which `ebrefile' imports to a new catalog file.
     SUBBOOKS must be a list of directory names of subbooks separeted
     by a comma (`,').  By default, all subbooks are specified as
     target.  (*Note Select Subbooks::, for more details).

`-v'
`--version'
     Output version number to standard out, then exit.
