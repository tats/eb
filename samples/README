Some sample programs of EB Library are placed at this directory.

The sample programs aren't compiled together with EB Library, unless
you invoke `configure' with the `--enable-samples' option.  If you
have not configured with `--enable-samples' (or configured with
`--disable-samples' or `--enable-samples=no'), and you want to complie
the sample programs, then please do the following procedure: 

	1. Compile EB Library.
	2. Change directory (`cd') to this directory.
	3. Type `make all'.
	(`make install' target is not provided.)

Usage of the sample programs are explained at the beginning of the
programs.
